            <h1>What is COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus)?</h1><p>COVID-19 is a new disease first discovered in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, that likely came from infected animals and spread to humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory problems mainly in people with medical problems, weakened immunity, and the elderly (age 60 and older). As of Mar. 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-9 the cause of a worldwide pandemic. Some infections result in fatal viral pneumonia. The current mortality rate (death rate) is about 4.76%, depending on the data available.</p>
            <h1>What can people do to prevent a COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus) infection?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><h1>Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h1><p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.

                        Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.</p></li>
                <li><h1> Avoid touching your face</h1><p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:</p> <ul><li>gas pump handle</li><li>your cell phone</li><li>a doorknob</li></ul><p>Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Stop shaking hands and hugging people</h1><p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Don’t share personal items</h1><p>Do not share personal items like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>phones</li>
                        <li>makeup</li>
                        <li>combs</li>
                    </ul><p>
                        It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h1><p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.

                        Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Wash fresh groceries</h1><p>Wash all produce under running water before eating or preparing.

                        The CDCTrusted Source and the FDATrusted Source do not recommend using soap, detergent, or commercial produce wash on things like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and after handling these items.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Avoid eating or drinking in public places</h1><p>Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other eateries.

                        The virus can be transmitted through food, utensils, dishes, and cups. It may also be temporarily airborne from other people in the venue.

                        You can still get delivery or takeaway food. Choose foods that are thoroughly cooked and can be reheated.

                        High heat (at least 132°F/56°C, according to one recent, not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) helps to kill coronaviruses.

                        This means it may be best to avoid cold foods from restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Do not gather in groups</h1><p>Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in close contact with someone.

                        This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks or beaches.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Take physical (social) distancing seriously</h1><p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms.

                        Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when possible.

                        If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.</p></li>
                <li><h1>Self-quarantine if sick</h1><p>Call your doctor if you have any symptoms. Stay home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or eating with your loved ones even if you live in the same home.

                        Wear a mask and wash your hands as much as possible. If you need urgent medical care, wear a mask and let them know you may have COVID-19.</p></li>
